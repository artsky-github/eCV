# eCV
Respository for my eCV. My CV was initially built using LibreOffice Writer and exported as an HTML document. There were some anomalies from the exportation that were fixed using CSS. Purpose of the eCV is to remove the need to upload my CV when applying in PDF or DOC format and instead applying an HTTPS link using Github Pages.
